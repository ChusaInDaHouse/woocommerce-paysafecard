# WooCommerce paysafecard Gateway
WooCommerce/WordPress Plugin to use paysafecard as payment method.

To use this plugin, you have to upload it to the wp-plugins folder of your WordPress installation. You can find more information about this process on the internet.
You then can set up the plugin with custom settings, such as API-Key and extra amount when paying with paysafecard.

Note: I donâ€™t recommend using this plugin in production. Please consider forking it so everyone can profit.
